### **_Description_**

Robota means work in Ukrainian. Robota is a mobile friendly platform to assist Ukrainian refugees in finding relevant jobs with ease. This app was created for a 3 Day International Aid Hackathon run by General Assembly. We were tasked with solving a problem for a specific country. Upon researching what refugees are struggling with the most, we learned that finding a job is the biggest challenge. Robota is currently specifically for Ukrainian refugees that have relocated to the state of Washington as this is where the majority of them have moved to within the United States. Featuring user authentication, this app has search filters specially catered to find the most common jobs for Ukrainians. The other set of users are companies who want to help Ukrainian refugees by posting jobs or tasks through the form. On our home page, we have provided icons of the most popular industries for refugees who are not proficient in English as a visual aid. Our team was thrilled to announce that Robota won first place by the judges of the Hackathon as well as "Crowd Favorite" by all of the attendees!
